# Deepfake Detection with EfficientNet-B0 🧠🕵️‍♂️

A deep learning-based image classification system to detect whether an image is **real** or a **deepfake**, built using **EfficientNet-B0**, **PyTorch**, and an interactive **Gradio** web interface.


## 🚀 Features

- ⚡ EfficientNet-B0 backbone for high accuracy with low computation.
- 📊 Visual confidence scores using bar charts.
- 
- 🧠 Softmax-based prediction with Real/Fake classification.
- 🗃️ Auto-logging of predictions to a CSV file.
- 📈 Multiple graph options available (trend, histogram, boxplot – extensible).
- 🌐 Gradio UI for simple image upload and instant prediction.
